Before starting, you must have the following. If you have any questions, you will gain support after you are approved and you have downloded the application.<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">• Basic computer knowledge- e.g. how to extract ZIP files.<br>• Know how to read English and follow instructions.<br>• A working email that you are able to check frequently.<br>• Java 8 or above, installed. (If you don't have it, <a href="https://java.com" target="_blank">download here</a>.)<br>• You agree not to do anything stupid, like leaking the application and its information, changing the code in the program, etc.<br>• Common sense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><em>HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL</em></strong><br>1) Go to the Download page of this website.<br>2) Request the application download.<br>3) Once your request gets accepted, click on the link that was sent to the email you provided.<br>4) Download the application from the link provided.<br>5) Extract the ZIP file into a folder in your documents, on your desktop, etc.<br>6) There should be 2 files: SecretList.jar and run.bat. Click on the run.bat and a command prompt will pop up.<br>7) The application will load. If you see an error with something about "EXPIRED PLEASE UPDATE", just re-download the application and re-do the steps. It means you need to update the application (more about common errors at the bottom).<br>8) If loading is successful, you will be asked for your username, which you can find in the email you received. If your username is valid, a password will be asked for, which is also included in the email.<br>9) If authentication is successful, you have successfully downloaded, installed, and set-up the applcaition.<br>10) Read the README FILE, and keep on reading this page for information on application usage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><em>USAGE</em></strong></span></p><p><strong>COMMANDS</strong><br>The Secret List Application has several commands: "List", and "More".<br>List: Lists everything from the Secret List.<br>More: Displays more information about the things from the secret list. Execute the command and wait until you are asked to enter an item ID. Extra information about the "thing" with the specified ID will be shown.</p><p><strong>AUTHENTICATE</strong><br>For security, the application will ask you to authenticate every time you run a command. It will ask for your username, then your password. Your credentials should be in the email you receive. Simply type your username/password and press enter.</p><p><strong>VIEWING THE LIST</strong><br>Well, it should be pretty self-explanatory once you extract the ZIP file. There is a BAT file called "List All Phrases". Simply click on that file and follow the steps in the "Authenticate" section. Then, the phrases should start popping up.</p><p><strong>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SOMETHING ON THE LIST</strong><br>Coming soon...</p><p><br></p><p><em>COMMON ERRORS</em></p><p><strong>"INVALID TOKEN"</strong><br>You will get this error if your "token" is incorrect. This means that you may have tampered with the program, or modified a BAT file.</p><p><strong>"INCORRECT TIME"</strong><br>Your device date is set incorrectly, or it's inaccurate. Don't try to manipulate your system time.</p><p><strong>"EXPIRED"</strong><br>Your application has expired, and you must reply to your approval email and request the updated version. You will not be contacted when applications expired, and you won't receive the update unless you ask.</p><p><strong>"NO COMMAND SPECIFIED"</strong><br>You did not specify a command. There is something wrong with your BAT file, it's probably because you tampered/edited it.</p><p><strong>"INCORRECT CREDENTIALS, TRY AGAIN"</strong><br>The most common error- your username and/or password is incorrect. Your credentials are specified in your approval email, as stated in the "Authenticate" section of this tutorial.</p><p><strong>"POSSIBLE ACCOUNT COMPROMISE (BANNED)"</strong><br>Your account may have been compromised (hacked, leaked, stolen) and you have been banned for security reasons. Reply to your approval email if you believe that this is incorrect.</p><p><strong>"404"</strong><br>The application could not find a text file online. Did you tamper with the JAR?</p><p><strong>"CONNECTION FAILED (INTERNET CONNECTION INVALID)"</strong><br>Your Internet is not working properly or you are not connected at all.</p><p><strong>"INTERRUPTEDEXCEPTION"</strong><br>This error is pretty rare. Restarting the application should fix this.</p><p><strong>"INVALID COMMAND"</strong><br>Did you edit the BAT file?</p><p><br></p><p><em>SUPPORT</em><br>If you need help or have any questions, make sure that you have read this tutorial carefully, then reply to your approval email if you have additional inquiries. Support is not given to those who aren't approved.</p></div>
